# Planet - Defense

## How to play
To start Press the spacebar, you are a turret on a small planet that is getting bombarded with asteroids and aliens! At first you must blast away the asteroids coming at your planet, but over time aliens will find you and launch a full blown attack. Satellites will randomply fly into your field of view and if you shoot them down before coliding with your planet they will give you a boost!

Cursor -> moves the direction of the turret 

click -> shoot a bullet 

spacebar -> Play and Pause the game

## Version two (If I ever decide to make it)

This version will add new features including:
  - better alien movement, less robotic.
  - Actual textures instead of images I made when I was too tired to program but wanted to keep working.
  - Better animation (Possibly).
  - More alien types in combat.
  - More advanced starting menu 
  - Day cycles
  - Bullet damage and enemy health
  - Upgrades for your turret over time
  - named highscores
  
  
  This game is likely going to be a small piece of a larger site where I post small games that I have made in a mini arcade. This site may just be another site I dream up and never build since college takes time but yea! Hopefully I get there, and if I do it will be fun :)
